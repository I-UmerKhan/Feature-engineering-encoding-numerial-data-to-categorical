# Feature-engineering-encoding-numerial-data-to-categorical
I used uniform and quantile binning techniques for discretizing continuous data into bins of equal width and equal frequency, respectively. Binning provides a way to discretize and organize data into meaningful groups, which can aid in analysis and model building across various domains, such as outlier treatment and feature engineering for machine learning.Additionally, I applied binarization techniques to transform numerical features into binary values based on a threshold, useful for specific types of models like logistic regression or decision trees.
